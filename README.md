# Romannumerals
First implementation using if-else to convert, second using arrays and for loop to reduce size of code. In second implementations(extended) programmer can use any type of data as an argument.
In this code is one fault. In simple convertion line 27 "if (temp > 3)" is useless and I forgot to remove this line when I was writing this code. I saw this after deadline of sending this task, so I don't want to change this. That's why I'm writing about this here.
